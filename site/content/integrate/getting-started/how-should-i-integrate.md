# How Should I Integrate?

Very good question! Mattermost has many different integration points and this page will help you pick the right one(s) for the job.

### I just want to post into Mattermost

If you only want to post messages into a Mattermost channel, then all you need is an [incoming webhook](/integrate/incoming-webhooks).

### I want to know when someone says something

Tracking what gets posted into a channel and receiving real-time events about it can be done using [outgoing webhooks](/integrate/outgoing-webhooks). You can also respond to messages with outgoing webhooks.

### I want user interaction

If you want your users to be able to trigger actions from within Mattermost, adding your own custom [slash command](/integrate/slash-commands) will do the trick.

That's not enough? You can include <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/interactive-messages.html">interactive messages</a> in posts from your slash commands, as well as from incoming and outgoing webhooks.

### I want to build an advanced bot

To build a richer bot integration, you can make full use of the [Mattermost REST API](/integrate/rest-api). Everything that you see a Mattermost client doing, your integration can do too with this API.

### One of these alone isn't enough

Good news! You can mix and match as many of these integration points you like to suit your needs. The choice is yours.

### I still need more

If these integration points aren't enough for what you had in mind, then take a look at [plugins](/extend/plugins/). They are very powerful and offer the ability to extend Mattermost in ways that integrations can't.
